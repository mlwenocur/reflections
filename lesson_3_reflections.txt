When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To protect against local disk crash, to enable others to clone it, and to amuse the old and educate the young.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automated pulling seems a way to ensure madness especially if the pulling occurs on the branch currently checked out. It might make sense if one is using the checked out repository to build the latest version of some application. Assuming of course that application features aren't disappearing or changing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is just a request for GitHub to clone the project and registers it under your username, whereas a clone can be done remotely or locally to create a new repository, though it is not clear what the advantage to a local clone might be. I suppose a local clone could be a way to instantiate a somewhat different version of the same application so that a debugger could be run on each repository separately. Branches happen in the same repository and use git's wonderfulness to keep track of different versions of the same code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
